                <p>It’s hard to believe. Has it already been a year? Looking back we’ve come a long way. In fact, we’ve grown so much since November, you probably wouldn’t even recognize us from a year ago. After all, we did have some major work done – major renovations, that is. </p>

                <p>Key West is filled with ghost stories. From lingering lovers to ghastly murders, the island is not without its share of haunted history. While ghost-hunters say these supernatural phenomenon can be seen year-round, we especially like to call forth the Halloween spirit in the month of October. </p>

                <p>Every November, the world’s biggest and fastest offshore racing series comes to Key West. Super Boat International, or Powerboat, as it’s referred to in Key West, is a week-long powerboating series featuring races, shows, parades, and parties, culminating in the grand-daddy of the <a href="http://superboat.com/" target="_blank">super boat</a> season, the world championships.
                  That means the world’s fastest boats going full throttle, speeding through Key West waters in pursuit of the world championship title. Engines roaring, these boats practically fly across the water, reaching speeds well over 100 miles per hour, all making the the annual <strong>Powerboat Championships</strong> a must see, racing fanatic or not.</p>

                <p>Fantasy Fest isn’t all body paint and crazy costumes, it also channels that island vibe we love so much about Key West. Kicking off the Conch Republic’s most infamous festival,<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BahamaVillageGoombayFestival" target="_blank">Bahama Village Goombay </a> gets the party started with a true Caribbean celebration, just like in the Bahamas. Held on the first Friday and Saturday of <a href="http://www.fantasyfest.com/schedule/" target="_blank">Fantasy Fest </a>, this is one tropical dance party you don’t want to miss. </p>

                <p>Fall in Key West means one thing for us - Fantasy Fest - the wildest party on the island and quite possibly the country. Fantasy Fest is 10 days of outrageous costumes, intoxicating debauchery, and parties galore. Started over 30 years ago as a way to encourage tourism during Key West’s low season, <a href="http://www.fantasyfest.com/" target="_blank">Fantasy Fest</a> has now turned October into high season in Key West. That said, <a href="http://www.24northhotel.com/rooms/" target="_blank">book your room</a> as soon as possible – they always go fast. </p>

                <p>Key West and Ernest Hemingway go way back. In the 1930s, Hemingway didn’t just have a house in Key West, he called Key West home. Whether he was officiating boxing matches at Blue Heaven or drinking with Joe Russell at Sloppy Joe’s, Hemingway had a strong presence on the island. And Conch Republicans like to keep that presence alive each July with a week-long party.</p>

                <p>Duval Street, i.e. the “unofficial” downtown of the Conch Republic, is hard to miss. This is where you’ll likely find yourself imbibing a few frozen beverages, or at the very least sauntering down in your search for more frozen beverages. Although there are tourist traps and bars galore lining Duval, there are still plenty of spots on Duval that are well worth your attention. Here are 24 North’s picks for a less inebriated, yet still intoxicating walk down Duval.</p>

                <p>With the only living coral reef in the continental United States, Key West is often a popular option for snorkeling and diving. However, as proud citizens of <a href="http://www.24northhotel.com/blog/unofficially-the-most-fun-in-key-west-conch-republic-independence-celebration/">the Conch Republic</a>, we do have our favorite spots to observe marine life.

                <p>It wouldn’t be May in Key West without the annual Songwriter’s Festival. This iconic festival honors the artists who write the hits for big billboard acts, but don’t perform them. Songwriter’s is an opportunity for these artists to perform their songs and tell the stories behind them. Headlining this year’s 21st annual festival are Jake Owen, Robert Earl Keen, Rhett Akins and Natalie Hemby.</p>

                <p>On April 23, 1982, Key West seceded from the United States, and the Conch Republic was born. The story goes that the U.S. Border Patrol set up a roadblock on one of the two roads that connects the archipelago to the mainland, causing a 17-mile traffic jam on the island. Seeing this act as a threat to their livelihood and the tourism industry, Key West residents protested. However, they didn’t use banners, signs and marches – they seceded.</p>
