	"more_content": "<p>Key West has gotten somewhat of a reputation in the Conch Republic for its drag shows. From the island&rsquo;s wildly popular Shoe Drop hosted by Sushi, to the various drag queens luring tourists into the cabarets on Duval, there&rsquo;s no lack of drag on Key West. Going to a drag show is just something you do while in Key West. Here are some of our favorite spots for drag on the island. <br /><br /><strong>801 Bourbon</strong><br />801 Duval Street<br />Key West, FL 33040<br /><br />Easily a household name in the Conch Republic, <a href=\"http://www.801bourbon.com/cabaret.html\">801 Bourbon</a> is where Sushi leads the girls in performances. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if you find yourself laughing hysterically. The drag shows at 801 Bourbon have always been more comedy than drag. And the performers do joke around with the audience. It&rsquo;s all in good fun, but if you have trouble taking a joke, you might want to consider a more traditional drag show.<br /><br /><strong>Aqua</strong> <br />711 Duval Street<br />Key West, FL 33040<br /><br />A favorite of locals and tourists alike, the <a href=\"http://www.aquakeywest.com/\">cabaret at Aqua</a> goes all out in this &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; drag show. Expect great costumes and lip-synced renditions of your favorite songs as part of Aqua&rsquo;s their &ldquo;Reality is a Drag&rdquo; cabaret. These ladies also know how to dance - quite well, we might add.&nbsp; Go for the good time and the Aquanettes, and stay for the strong pours. The cover is worth it. <br /><br /><strong>LaTeDa</strong><br />1125 Duval Street<br />Key West, FL 33040<br /><br />By far the drag show with the biggest production budget on the island, <a href=\"http://lateda.com/cabaret/\">LaTeDa</a> is famous for its long-running show &ldquo;Eyecons&rdquo; by Chris Peterson, as well for its cabaret by Randy Roberts. Both shows pay homage to the 20th century&rsquo;s most iconic women. Get ready for Marilyn, Madonna, Lucille, and many more. No lip-syncing here. These girls can sing. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>",
