In fact, you could argue that it&rsquo;s Key West&rsquo;s best season. The weather is impeccable. With highs in the mid-70s, tons of sunshine, and cool breezes, it&rsquo;s the closest thing to heaven on earth and by far the best way to spend Christmas vacation. Collectively called the <a href=\"http://www.keywestchristmas.org/Welcome.html\">&ldquo;Bight&rdquo; Before Christmas</a>, the local ensemble of holiday events might be a little unorthodox in some of its presentations, but none are lacking in Christmas cheer. That said, here are a few events to get you in the Christmas spirit:</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Key West Harbor Walk of Lights<br /></span></strong><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Through December 31, 2016. Lights at 6:00 p.m.<br /></span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Lining the Key West Bight is the annual Harbor Walk of Lights. With Christmas trees made out of fishing traps and tackle, Santa, and jingles in the air, this is one place to peruse with a Christmas spirit in hand. The lights go on every night at 6:00 p.m. and Santa is always stationed at the nautical Christmas tree for pictures with you and your pets. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Lighted Boat Parade<br /></span></strong><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Saturday, December 10, 2016 at 8:00 p.m.<br /></span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">In Key West, it just seems natural to decorate the boats with Christmas lights. For 26 years and counting, the Keys&rsquo; has been donning its finest decorations, floats and designs in front of the judges of </span><span lang=\"EN-US\"><a href=\"http://www.schoonerwharf.com/16boatparade.htm\">Schooner Wharf Bar</a></span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> in the annual lighted boat parade. If you&rsquo;re not planning on decorating your own boat, consider joining the party on one of </span><span lang=\"EN-US\"><a href=\"https://www.furycat.com/key-west/lighted-boat-parade\">Fury Water Sports</a></span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> catamarans. It&rsquo;s the closest seat in the house.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Holiday Historic Inn Tours<br /></span></strong><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Friday, December 9, 2016 at 6:00 p.m. &amp; Friday, December 16, 2016 at 6:00 p.m.<br /></span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">What Key West lacks in snow, it makes up for in spirit during the Christmas season &ndash; especially during the Holiday Historic Inn Tours. Not only are these tours through some of Key West&rsquo;s oldest inns, they&rsquo;re also completely decorated from head to toe in Christmas lights and other holiday festivities. Grab the family and explore these historic homes while taking advantage of the &ldquo;holiday cheer&rdquo; that is always close by, i.e. Christmas treats and traditional beverages. Tickets are available through the <a href=\"https://keystix.ticketforce.com/eventperformances.asp?evt=457\">official website.</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Conch Republic Holiday Classic Car Show<br /></span></strong><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Sunday, December 18, 2014, 12:00 &ndash; 4:00 p.m.<br /></span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Another Key West holiday tradition, the Holiday Classic Car Show is back in front of the Conch Republic Seafood Company. Here you can see cars that go all the way back to the early 1900s, as well as some classic models you probably dreamed of owning as a kid. Hosted by the <a href=\"http://thesouthernmostcarclub.com/\">Southernmost Car Club</a>, the show brings a shiny mix of antique, classic and exotic cars to Old Town Key West, all with some serious eye candy under the hood. Admission is free, but organizers ask that you bring a toy as a donation.&nbsp;</span></p>","blogimage":{"url":"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_1001/media/bight-before-christmas.jpg"}}
