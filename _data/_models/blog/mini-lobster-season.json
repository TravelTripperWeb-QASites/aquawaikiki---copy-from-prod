But come 12:01 a.m. Friday, July 29, 2016, and the harvesting of lobster is once again prohibited. This &ldquo;mini&rdquo; lobster season is just that &ndash; mini - hence the name, &ldquo;Mini-Lobster Season.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While the name &ldquo;mini-lobster&rdquo; evokes images of tiny crustaceans, or some smaller, lobster cousin, Mini-Lobster Season actually has nothing to do with baby lobsters. The only thing &ldquo;mini&rdquo; about Mini-Lobster Season is that, legally, this lobster season can only be held for two days. That&rsquo;s because the official Florida lobster season, which runs for 8 months, doesn&rsquo;t start until August 6th. Think of Mini-Lobster Season as a pre-party, held every year on the last consecutive Wednesday and Thursday in July.</p>\n<p>Another difference is that while lobster season attracts many commercial fishermen, Mini-Lobster Season is more of a recreational sport season. In fact, thousands converge on Key West during the last week in July for this very reason.</p>\n<p>Although Mini-Lobster Season is intended as recreation, there are<a href=\"http://myfwc.com/fishing/saltwater/recreational/lobster/\" target=\"_blank\"> a few rules</a> that must be followed.</p>\n<p><strong>Florida Keys (Monroe County) Mini-Lobster Season Rules</strong></p>\n<p>-You may need to purchase a license (don&rsquo;t worry, they&rsquo;re cheap). Check the <a href=\"http://www.myfwc.com/license/recreational/do-i-need-a-license/\" target=\"_blank\">Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission requirements. </a><br /> - Only 6 lobsters per person are permitted <br /> - The lobster carapace must measure MORE than 3 inches<br /> - Lobsters must be measured in the water <br /> - In some areas, such as the Dry Tortugas, lobster harvesting is prohibited. Check for <a href=\"http://myfwc.com/fishing/saltwater/recreational/lobster/\" target=\"_blank\">a complete list.</a><br /> - It is illegal to possess and/or harvest ANY egg-bearing female lobster (egg-bearing lobsters are identified by the bright-orange eggs on their undersides).<br /> - During Mini-Lobster Season, it is illegal to dive at night. However, lobsters may be harvested with bully-nets above water. <br /> - Due to the lionfish invasion, the State of Florida is offering divers <a href=\"http://myfwc.com/news/news-releases/2015/june/25/lionfish-lobster/\" target=\"_blank\">an extra spiny lobster with the capture of 10 lionfish. </a></p>\n<p><strong>Catching a Spiny Lobster </strong></p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t think you can catch a lobster? Think again. It&rsquo;s pretty simple. You only need a snorkel, a poker and a net. Scuba gear is optional, but not necessary. Look for the lobster&rsquo;s spikes poking out from under a rock or underwater crevice. Have your net ready and then give it a poke to make the lobster come out of its hiding spot.</p>\n<p>Still not sure you want to provoke a lobster? Unlike other species of lobsters, the Florida spiky lobster doesn&rsquo;t have claws. You won&rsquo;t have to worry about getting pinched.</p>\n<p>That said, you&rsquo;ve still got a few days to book your Mini-Lobster trip. We know just the spot.</p>\n<p><em>The above rules apply only to the Caribbean spiny lobster. The State of Florida does not regulate the harvest of the other lobster species. Mini-Lobster Season 2016 is Wednesday, July 27 and Thursday, July 28. </em></p>","short_description":"<p>At 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, July 27, 2016, you can catch your very own lobster in the Florida Keys.
