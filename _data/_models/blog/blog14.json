That&rsquo;s why Tennessee William&rsquo;s March birthday is a national [Conch Republic] holiday. We drink wine and eat cake. But it&rsquo;s not just on March 26 that us Conchs honor the famous American playwright - it&rsquo;s all month. After all, Tennessee Williams called Key West home for over forty years. It&rsquo;s only right we honor him. Starting February 28, 2017, the Tennessee Williams festivities begin. But here are some we&rsquo;re especially looking forward to:<br /><br />For two weekends in a row, A Fringe Theater is putting on one of William&rsquo;s most famous plays, &ldquo;<strong>A Glass Menagerie</strong>,&rdquo; at St. Paul&rsquo;s Church. If you can&rsquo;t make it from March 16-18, 2017, you also have the opportunity from March 23-25, 2017. Both showings start at 7:00 p.m.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_1345/media/2017-03-02-191810/TennesseeWilliams2.jpg\" /><br /><br />Another performance that can&rsquo;t be missed is &ldquo;<strong>Tennessee Williams: His Words in Letters</strong>.&rdquo; Drawing from the author&rsquo;s personal struggle with love, loss, and depression, this play chronicles Williams ups and downs while giving insight to his creative process.</p>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s <strong>Tennessee Williams Monday Night Classic Film Series</strong>, a Key West tradition held weekly at Tropic Cinema throughout the month of March. See Williams iconic screenplays on the big screen. This year they&rsquo;re showing &ldquo;A Streetcar Named Desire,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Rose Tattoo,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond.&rdquo; The films start at 6:00 p.m., but get there a little early to get a good seat.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_1345/media/2017-03-02-191813/shutterstock_572428828.jpg\" width=\"529\" height=\"529\" /></p>\n<p><br />There&rsquo;s also a few contests in the playwright&rsquo;s honor. There&rsquo;s the<strong> Plein Air Painting Contest</strong> happening on March 4, 2017, which channels the William&rsquo;s fondness for painting, with this year&rsquo;s participants will paint the iconic Tropic Cinema. However, there are also two literary contests - the <strong>Short Story Contest</strong> and the <strong>Poetry Contest</strong>, both happening on March 8, 2017. For more information, consult <a href=\"http://www.twkw.org/events.html\">the contest details</a>.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_1345/media/2017-03-02-191812/TW3.jpeg\" width=\"670\" height=\"536\" /></p>\n<p>And finally, a Tennessee William&rsquo;s birthday celebration wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without a visit to the <strong>Tennessee Williams Key West Exhibit</strong>. Located at 513 Truman Avenue, this exhibit features first editions of Williams&rsquo; plays and novels, numerous photographs, rare and original newspaper clippings, and even the typewriter Williams used while in Key West.<br /><br />Which will you attend?</p>",
