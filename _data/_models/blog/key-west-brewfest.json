A beer-lover&rsquo;s paradise - in paradise - this popular Key West festival features tastings from craft breweries and international brands, brunch, lunch, and dinner parings, pool parties, games, and great live music.</p>\n<p>The main event most often associated with <a href=\"http://www.keywestbrewfest.com/tickets\" target=\"_blank\">Brewfest</a> is a tasting festival held at Southernmost Beach Resort on<strong> Saturday, September 3, 2016.</strong> With almost <a href=\"http://www.keywestbrewfest.com/beers\" target=\"_blank\">200 different beers</a>, festival-goers can choose from a wide array of world-class beers such as Belgian ales, German hefeweizens, Kona porters and American ambers. Local favorites the <a href=\"http://www.floridakeysbrewingco.com/#!the-beer/fv034\" target=\"_blank\">Florida Keys Brewing Co</a>. and the <a href=\"http://www.floridabeer.com/#!product-families/cqnr\" target=\"_blank\">Florida Beer Company</a> will also be serving up their concoctions.</p>\n<p>However, the tasting festival doesn&rsquo;t even tap the surface of Brewfest. Kicking off on <strong>Thursday, September 1, 2016,</strong> are the numerous parings and parties as part of Brewfest 2016. While the official opening party starts at Waterfront Brewery at 5 p.m., we&rsquo;re also looking forward to <strong>Fury Water Adventures&rsquo;</strong> maiden <a href=\"https://www.furycat.com/key-west/brewfest-cruise\" target=\"_blank\">Brewfest Brews Cruise</a>. Fury knows how to throw a booze cruise &ndash; and we&rsquo;re expecting this one to exceed expectations. With local craft beers, wines, margs, pretzels, sliders, live music and that gorgeous Key West sunset &ndash; we&rsquo;re there.</p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"http://www.keywestbrewfest.com/event-information\" target=\"_blank\">event on our list</a> is the <strong>Florida Tap Takeover</strong> next door to 24 North at <a href=\"http://www.gateshotelkeywest.com/eat-drink/best-hotel-pool-key-west/\" target=\"_blank\">Rum Row</a>. Hosted by our sister hotel <a href=\"http://www.gateshotelkeywest.com/about-gates-of-key-west-hotel/\" target=\"_blank\">The Gates</a>, this all&ndash;day pool party has live music, a DJ at night, and lots of local beer. The party starts <strong>Friday, September 2, 2016, at 11 a.m.</strong></p>\n<p>On Sunday it&rsquo;s gonna be tough for us to choose. Both Rum Row and <a href=\"http://www.themarkerkeywest.com/location/]\" target=\"_blank\">The Marker</a> are throwing some great parties. <a href=\"http://konabrewingco.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kona Beer</a> and Key West&rsquo;s DJ Jimmy will be taking over <strong>The Marker from 1-4 p.m. on Sunday</strong>, while <a href=\"http://www.cigarcityusa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cigar City</a> is hosting a <strong>beer pong tournament in the pool at Rum Row from 1-5 p.m.</strong> It&rsquo;s a tough call. Rum Row is so close to<a href=\"http://www.24northhotel.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> 24 North</a>, but now with the <a href=\"http://www.24northhotel.com/blog/old-town-key-west-shuttle/\" target=\"_blank\">Old Town Shuttle</a>, it&rsquo;s just as easy &ndash; if not easier -to get to The Marker. Decisions, decisions. We&rsquo;ll let you decide.</p>\n<p>Parties aside, make sure to get tickets for at least one of the beer pairings over the long weekend. Some of the island&rsquo;s best restaurants and chefs are teaming up to create specialty menus to compliment the festival&rsquo;s featured beers. Blue Heaven, <a href=\"http://islecookkeywest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Isle Cook</a>, and Mellow Caf&eacute; and Gastropub are all participating, as well as Roostica, whose <a href=\"http://www.keywestbrewfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/BrewFest-Menu.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bacon &amp; Brew Dinner</a> looks especially appetizing. And finally, if you happen to go to the main festival on Saturday, make sure to stay until the end. New Orleans&rsquo; brass band Water Seed will be leading the <strong>Second Line March throughout Old Town</strong>, which one of Key West&rsquo;s best excuses to dance in the street.</p>\n<p><em> For a complete list of times and events, consult the Key West Brewfest <a href=\"http://www.keywestbrewfest.com/event-information\" target=\"_blank\">schedule of events</a>. The main tasting event will be held Friday and Saturday from 5-8 p.m. at the Southernmost Beach Resort on 1319 Duval Street. Tickets are $40 in advance and $50 at the door.</em></p>","short_description":"<p>It&rsquo;s not Labor Day weekend in Key West without <a href=\"http://www.keywestbrewfest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brewfest</a>.
