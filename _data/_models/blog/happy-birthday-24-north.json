And while we won&rsquo;t go naming any names, their style wasn&rsquo;t very 24 North. So we <a href=\"http://www.24northhotel.com/gallery/\" target=\"_blank\"> completely renovated </a> the space to give it the modern vibe you see now, without loosing any of the island essence. It&rsquo;s about feeling like you&rsquo;re on an island resort without actually being cut-off from civilization. However, when you want to deal with civilization you can, we&rsquo;ll even <a href=\"http://www.24northhotel.com/location/\" target=\"_blank\"> drive you. </a></p>\n<div class=\"post-image-holder\"><img src=\"/images/blog/happy-birthday-24-north-3.jpg\" alt=\"On November 4, 2016, 24 North Hotel is turning 1.\" /></div>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve also probably noticed our distinctly Cuban vibe. Whether it&rsquo;s our Caribbean blue shutters, the breathtaking photos by <a href=\"http://www.24northhotel.com/blog/an-interview-with-jorge-de-la-torriente-of-de-la-gallery/\" target=\"_blank\"> Jorge de la Torriente, </a> or our hospitality, much of 24 North&rsquo;s style pulls from Key West&rsquo;s Cuban history. Being only 90 miles to Cuba, there was a time when it was easier to get to Havana than Miami. While some Conchs might have forgotten that, we haven&rsquo;t. Even our name is a reference to the Key West &ndash; Cuba connection. What you may not have realized is that Key West and Cuba are located on the same latitude line, 24&deg;N. Hence our name, 24 North.</p>\n<div class=\"post-image-holder\"><img src=\"/images/blog/happy-birthday-24-north-4.jpg\" alt=\"On November 4, 2016, 24 North Hotel is turning 1.\" /></div>\n<p>So come celebrate with us. We&rsquo;ve got a great pool, just the right mix of Key West sun and palm tree shade, delicious tacos and top-notch drinks from our restaurant Chug Cantina, an exercise center overlooking our lush grounds, and of-course, the most hospitable staff on this side of 24&deg;N. We even have our very own Starbucks on-site, and our friends from Fury Watersports to organize all your Key West excursions. And that&rsquo;s all within one year. Just think what we&rsquo;ll have for you <a href=\"http://www.24northhotel.com/rooms/\" target=\"_blank\">when you visit us</a> for birthday #2.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>","short_description":"<p><strong>On November 4, 2016, 24 North Hotel is turning 1.</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe.
