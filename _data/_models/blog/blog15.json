Our on-site Starbucks has been the icing on the cake, or should we say the whipped cream on our frappucino since it&rsquo;s opening inside the hotel. And as if we weren&rsquo;t excited enough for spring drink season at Starbucks, they&rsquo;ve gone and surprised us with two new flavors, perfect for lounging poolside at 24 North. Welcome home, Iced Cinnamon Almond Milk Macchiato and Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato, we think you&rsquo;ll like 24 North as much as we do.</p>\n<p><strong>Now, about our new additions:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_1117/media/2017-03-07-023602/Starbucks-Photo2.JPG\" /></strong></p>\n<p>Inspired by the sweet, agua fresca horchata, the Iced Cinnamon Almond Milk Macchiato is made with Starbucks traditional espresso roast, covered with almond milk, a dash of cinnamon dolce syrup, and drizzled with Starbucks&rsquo; signature caramel sauce. It sounds like a drink made in heaven, which is why we&rsquo;re thinking the Iced Cinnamon Almond Milk Macchiato is perfect for those sunny, not-a-cloud-in-the-sky Key West days. After all, isn&rsquo;t heaven having a Starbucks just steps from your Key West hotel room?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_1117/media/2017-03-07-023621/Starbucks-Photo3.JPG\" /></p>\n<p>And then there&rsquo;s the Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato. You might remember this macchiato from last year when they were testing it out. The Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato comes with fresh-brewed espresso, creamy coconut milk, and a healthy dose of caramel. It&rsquo;s then swirled to perfection with white chocolate mocha sauce. Can we say to die for? If you like, order it hot. The Key West spring is so pleasant, you won&rsquo;t won&rsquo;t feel the need to douse your drink in ice. In fact, you might want it that way.</p>\n<p>See you at the 24 North Starbucks!</p>"
