The fun-loving capital of the Conch Republic is never at a loss for humor, drinks or adventure. In true Key West fashion, you won&rsquo;t go far without a margarita or daiquiri in hand, but you&rsquo;ll also explore the Florida Reef, kayak through the back country, and witness dolphins in their natural habitat. You&rsquo;ll drink Cuban coffee by the sea and devour fish tacos. You&rsquo;ll catch Key West&rsquo;s famous sunset at Mallory Square and you&rsquo;ll brush up on your American (and Cuban) history. At some point you&rsquo;ll succumb to the vices on Duval &ndash; that&rsquo;s inevitable &ndash; drinking and dancing like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow. Except there is a tomorrow, in which you&rsquo;ll do it all over again.</p>\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the live music, or the laid-back vibe, Key West has a way of inviting you in and convincing you to stay.
