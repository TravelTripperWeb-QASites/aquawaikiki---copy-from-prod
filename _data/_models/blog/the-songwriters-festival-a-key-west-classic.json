This iconic festival honors the artists who write the hits for big billboard acts, but don&rsquo;t perform them. Songwriter&rsquo;s is an opportunity for these artists to perform their songs and tell the stories behind them. Headlining this year&rsquo;s 21st annual festival are Jake Owen, Robert Earl Keen, Rhett Akins and Natalie Hemby.</p>\n<p>The beauty of Songwriter&rsquo;s is that it&rsquo;s a chance to hear the songs you know and love, in the way they were intended. It&rsquo;s like hearing these famous songs for the first time &ndash; and at the same time giving a well-deserved nod to the writers that wrote them.</p>\n<p>In fact, Songwriter&rsquo;s is one of our favorite times of the year in Key West. Not only is it an opportunity to hear great music all over the island, but it&rsquo;s also one of the liveliest times of the season. All of Key West gets together to support its Songwriter&rsquo;s, including 24 North Hotel. However, we don&rsquo;t just take part in the festivities, we host them.</p>\n<p>Join us next door at our sister location, The Gates Hotel, on <span class=\"bold-text\">Saturday, May 7 at 1 pm</span> for our <a href=\"http://www.keywestsongwritersfestival.com/event-5.7.16-TheGates.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rum Row Pool Party</a> and again on <span class=\"bold-text\">Sunday, May 8 at 11 am</span> for our <a href=\"http://www.keywestsongwritersfestival.com/event-5.8.16-TheGates.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rum Row Bloody Mary Party</a>.
