In the 1930s, Hemingway didn&rsquo;t just have a house in Key West, he called Key West home. Whether he was officiating boxing matches at <a href=\"http://www.blueheavenkw.com/#!ourstory/c4ko\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Heaven</a> or drinking with Joe Russell at Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s, Hemingway had a strong presence on the island. And Conch Republicans like to keep that presence alive each July with a week-long party.</p>\n<p><strong>Hemingway Days</strong> are an ode to the famous writer, complete with some of his favorite pastimes and memories - fishing, writing, and drinking. No matter which events you attend, you can always expect an after-party to follow.</p>\n<p>First, there&rsquo;s the <strong>Papa Look-Alike Contest</strong>, hosted by <a href=\"https://sloppyjoes.com/papa-look-alike-contest/\" target=\"_blank\">Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s</a>. Each year over 100 bearded men vie for the honor of being named Hemingway&rsquo;s closest resemblance. Although there are three rounds, the final competition will be held on <strong>July 23, 2016, at 6:30 p.m.</strong></p>\n<p>Also concerning the &ldquo;Papas,&rdquo; is <strong>Hemingway&rsquo;s yearly birthday cake celebration</strong>, hosted by Sloppy Joes and the previous look-alike contestants. That party starts on <strong>Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 5:30 p.m.</strong></p>\n<p>Another Hemingway-esque event is the annual <strong>Key West Marlin Tournament</strong>. Spread out over three days, this <a href=\"http://www.keywestmarlin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">tournament</a> is for the serious sportsman (i.e. the grand-prize is $50K). Yet, even if fishing isn&rsquo;t your forte, you can still catch the daily tournament weigh-ins at <strong>Dante&rsquo;s Key West Pool Bar. </strong>Check <a href=\"http://www.fla-keys.com/news/news.cfm?sid=9338\" target=\"_blank\">the schedule</a> for exact times. The Key West Marlin Tournament is also hosting a cocktail party and island-style pig roast at Dante&rsquo;s on<strong> Thursday, July 21 at 6:30 p.m. </strong></p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re especially looking forward to the <strong>Hemingway 5K Sunset Run and Paddleboard Race on Saturday, July 23, 2016. </strong>Hosted by our friends <a href=\"http://papaspilar.com/#/papaspilar/landing\" target=\"_blank\">Papa&rsquo;s Pilar Rum</a> and <a href=\"http://lazydog.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lazy Dog Adventures</a>, the Sunset Run and Paddleboard Race kicks off at <strong>6 p.m. at the Southernmost Beach</strong> with a 3-mile course through the Atlantic Ocean. <strong>Runners start at 7:30 p.m. at the Southernmost Point</strong>. You can <a href=\"http://www.keywesthalfmarathon.com/hemingway-5k-sunset-run-paddle-board-race/\" target=\"_blank\">register here</a>.</p>\n<p>However, the most eye-catching event has to be the <strong>Running of the Bulls</strong>. On <strong>Saturday, July 23, 2016, at 1 p.m.</strong> the Papas will parade through Old Town Key West on their own special &ldquo;breed&rdquo; of bulls, singing and chanting and causing a stir as a nod to Hemingway&rsquo;s love of the Fiesta de San Ferm&iacute;n in Pamplona, Spain.</p>\n<p>Aside from the contests and parties, there are also several notable cultural events happening during Hemingway Days. The exhibition, &ldquo;<strong>Depicting Hemingway</strong>,&rdquo; by marine-life artist Guy Harvey will be on display at the <a href=\"http://www.kwahs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Key West Art &amp; Historical Society</a>. The society will also feature scholarly presentations, while the Key West Poetry Guild will hold Hemingway poetry readings at various points throughout the festival.
