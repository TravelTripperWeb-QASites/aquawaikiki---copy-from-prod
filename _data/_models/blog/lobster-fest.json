{"title":"Key West Events: Lobsterfest 2016","blogimage":{"url":"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/359_384_818/media/lobster-fest.jpg"},"url_friendly_name":"lobster-fest","date":"2016-8-02","Posted_by":"Admin","more_content":"<p>Thursday, August 11- Sunday, August 14, 2016</p>\n<p>With Florida lobster season kicking off the first week in August, Key West Lobsterfest isn&rsquo;t far behind. Thrown in honor of the Florida spiny lobster, this festival is easily the island&rsquo;s tastiest long weekend. Stuffed to the brim with food, Coronas, and live music, <a href=\"http://www.keywestlobsterfest.com/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lobsterfest</a> knows how to celebrate the best that Key West has to offer. You&rsquo;ll find the guest of honor everywhere this weekend - on the grill, in the fryer, in tacos, ceviches and rolls prepared with care by the island&rsquo;s local chefs. After all, it&rsquo;s only right that Key West&rsquo;s most important crustacean gets one of Key West&rsquo;s best parties.</p>\n<p>Lobsterfest festivities start on Thursday, August 11 at 5 p.m. with <a href=\"https://keywestwalkingtours.zaui.net/data/portals/lobsterfest/index.php?action=&amp;startDate=2016-08-11\" target=\"_blank\">the lobster boil</a> at the Sunset Tiki Bar &amp; Grill. It&rsquo;s a feast, for sure, with plates piled high with lobster, shrimp, Andouille sausage, crawfish, potatoes, and corn, all in front of a gorgeous ocean view on the Tiki Bar &amp; Grill patio.</p>\n<p>On Friday, there&rsquo;s the catamaran tour &ldquo;Reef &amp; Ritas&rdquo; sponsored by Margarita Life and fulfilled by our friends at Fury Water Adventures. One of Fury&rsquo;s most famous tours, <a href=\"https://www.furycat.com/key-west/snorkel\" target=\"_blank\">Reef &amp; Ritas</a> is a snorkel trip to the Florida Reef, with margaritas and live music. It&rsquo;s great for seeing the natural beauty of Key West and it&rsquo;s also a perfect start if you&rsquo;re planning on the Duval Crawl pub tour later in the evening.</p>\n<p>However, Lobsterfest&rsquo;s most popular attraction is Saturday&rsquo;s street fair. Live music, local art and blocks and blocks of lobster line Duval Street. From honey-fried lobster tails to bisques, cakes, tacos, and fritters, there&rsquo;s just about every style of lobster available. The music starts around 1 p.m., with <a href=\"http://www.keywestlobsterfest.com/street-fair-concert.html\" target=\"_blank\">Key West musicians</a> Alphonse, Bubba System, Cool Breeze, and the DurtBags all playing until 10:30 p.m. Grab a frozen or a Corona and eat your heart out.</p>\n<p>And finally, if you still didn&rsquo;t get your lobster fix, there&rsquo;s the Lobster Brunch on Sunday, August 14 at 11 a.m. at the Key West Marriott Beachside. After that, you&rsquo;ll have to wait until next year&rsquo;s Lobsterfest to celebrate Key West&rsquo;s most delicious resident.
