And this year, we here at 24 North aren&rsquo;t just participating, we&rsquo;re hosting, too.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mark your calendars for January 28, 2017. From 5-8 p.m., we&rsquo;ll be throwing a <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Grilled Cheese &amp; Beer Pairing</strong>, outside by our gorgeous pool. On the <a href=\"https://www.keywestfoodandwinefestival.com/grilled-cheese.html\">menu</a> are various artisanal sandwiches like Harvarti + Lobster, accompanied by the local Ballast Point Longfin Lager, or a mix of apple, bacon, and brie to go with the Cigar City Jai Alai.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, if you happen to be in town a day early, on Friday, January 27, 2017, drop in next door at our sister hotel, The Gates, for a pinot tasting benefiting Pawadise Pet Rescue. Not only do you get to soak up as much pinot noir as you&rsquo;d like, the more you drink, the more you end up donating to a good cause. Every $1 from each pinot sold goes to the foundation &ndash; and there will be adoptions available as well.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Now, if you get into town really early, our friends at The Marker are throwing a &ldquo;Girls Night Out&rdquo; on Tuesday, January 24. Think of it as the pre-game to Henry Flager&rsquo;s Welcome Party, the annual kick-off commemorating the railroad tycoon behind the Overseas Railroad.</p>\n<p>Once we&rsquo;re done hosting, we&rsquo;re hoping to get a spot on one of the walking tours. Not only do you get a guided tour of Old Town, but you get to stop in at the restaurants along the way. This year the <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">&ldquo;Neighborhood Strolls&rdquo;</strong> go through both Bahama Village and the Historic Seaport. There&rsquo;s also the <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">&ldquo;Bad Ass Brunch Series&rdquo;</strong> which features both new and classic brunch spots, like the Roof Top Caf&eacute; and Key West newcomer, Blue Macaw, which is rumored to have one of the best Bloody Marys on the island.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For the wine connoisseurs, there are several <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">wine seminars,</strong> covering French wines, Rieslings, and Pinot Noirs from around the world. The seminar &ldquo;The Riesling Revolution&rdquo; looks especially interesting, as it will cover the current trend in production of dry Rieslings in the United States. For a complete list of the wine seminars and tastings, consult the schedule <a href=\"https://www.keywestfoodandwinefestival.com/learn.html\">here.</a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, the biggest event by far is the <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Master Chefs Classic</strong>, in which Key West&rsquo;s top chefs compete to create the best appetizers, entrees, and desserts for those in attendance. Space is limited, and the event is popular, so if you&rsquo;re interested, make sure to <a href=\"http://www.marchouse.org/masterchefsclassic/\">reserve your space</a> as soon as possible. If you&rsquo;re looking for something more intimate, there&rsquo;s the festival&rsquo;s <strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\">Winemaker Dinner Series</strong>. In this series, winemakers and sommeliers pair their wines with meals specially crafted plates to create exquisite meals and one-of-a-kind experiences.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">That said, whether you&rsquo;re a foodie or if you just really like to eat, the Key West Food &amp; Wine Festival is one of the most delicious ways to spend your vacation in Key West. Make sure to pack your flip-flops &ndash; they&rsquo;re required!</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">For a complete list of events, here&rsquo;s the </em><a href=\"https://www.keywestfoodandwinefestival.com/event-schedule.html\"><em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">schedule.</em></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","short_description":"<p>Every January, Key West stuffs itself with some of the best cuisine that south Florida has to offer during the Key West Food &amp; Wine Festival.
